## Choice 1: Streamline `ssh` Configuration

In this lab report we will explore how to setup our `ssh` command into ieng6 through a more streamlined process, which will effectively save us the trouble of having to write out the entire address of our ieng6 account each time.

*Note this is setup using a Windows machine

## Step 1: `~/.ssh/config`

The first thing we need to do is to locate our file named `~/.ssh/config` which essentially tells our `ssh` command what username we want to use when logging in, which in this case is our ieng6 accounts. It also allows us to create a nickname for the server that we are trying to ssh into.

As such, we want to locate this file and add our own individual username into this file so that we can access our ieng6 accounts through the command `ssh ieng6`
